Signal models for some typical multiplets (singlet, doublet, triplet, quadruplet and doublet of doublet) are included 
in multiNMRFit, and users can also build their own models.

.. note:: We would be happy to broaden the types of models shipped with multiNMRFit. If you have developed a new model, it might be 
          usefull and valuable to the fluxomics community! Please, keep in touch with us to discuss and see if we can include your 
          model in the built-in models shipped with multiNMRFit! :)

The models used in MultiNMRFit can be found in the models folder. All models follow the same 
format. Have a look to 'model_singlet.py' as a template.

Users can add additionnal custom models following this format. We'll provide detailed information 
on the construction of new models soon! In the meantime, do not hesitate to grab us a message or 
open an issue in our GitHub repository, we will be happy to help!
